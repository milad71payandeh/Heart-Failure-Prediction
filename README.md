# Heart-Failure-Prediction
New decision support system in predicting heart failure using logistic regression algorithm

for analysis, data just run Section 1

To check the correlation between numerical features, run Section 2

To check the correlation between categorical features, run Section 3

To See the Correlation between numerical Features and labels, run Section 4

To See the Correlation between categorical Features and labels, run Section 5

section 6 is for Logistic Regression Model - Accuracy

Section 7 is for Logistic Regression Model - Accuracy (after balancing)

**Section 8: LR Classification Report **

Run section 9 to check the results of the KNN model

Run section 10 to check the results of the ANN model
